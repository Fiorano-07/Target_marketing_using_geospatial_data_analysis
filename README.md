It involves continuous data-driven decision-making while adhering to data privacy regulations

#Library used:-
Pandas
Geopy
Scikit-Learn
Folium.

#Prerequisites

1. Programming Language:

Python: You should have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) or use a Python distribution like Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/), which includes many data science libraries.
2. Libraries and Packages:

You will need to install and import several Python libraries and packages for data manipulation, geospatial analysis, and data visualization. The key libraries include:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Geopy: For geocoding and reverse geocoding.
Scikit-Learn: For machine learning tasks such as clustering.
Folium: For creating interactive maps.
You can install these libraries using Python's package manager, pip, by running commands like pip install pandas, pip install geopy, etc.

3. Data:

You'll need access to the relevant data for your project, including customer location data, competitor location data, demographic data, and any other datasets that are necessary for your analysis.

4. Geospatial Data Tools:

If your project involves more advanced geospatial analysis or handling geographic boundary data, you may need additional tools and libraries such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software (e.g., QGIS or ArcGIS) or specialized geospatial libraries like GeoPandas.

5. Development Environment:

You can work on your project using a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice. Popular choices for data science and analysis include Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, and Spyder.
